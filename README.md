# Notepad
My first Android app.

This app is a notepad. It allows the user to write simple notes and save them to text files, which are internal to the app's installation. It has many of the same functions as the popular Notepad program on the Windows platform, and it has been specially designed to comfortably fit into any phone/tablet's display. 

Screenshots coming soon!
