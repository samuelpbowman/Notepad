# Notepad
My first real Android app

This app is my first "real" app because I conceived it and worked on it independent of a guiding tutorial; 
instead, I primarily consulted the Android developer site and StackOverflow, which both gave answers to 
specific questions without spoonfeeding me all of the needed information.

The app is a text editor. Knowing that there are thousands of text editors on the Play Store, I completed 
this app on the recommendation of a website giving recommendations on simple projects for Android beginners.
Link coming soon.

Given a text field, the user can input text to her heart's content. There are operable buttons which can 
create new files, open existing files, and save the current file within the main activity. There will be a 
dialog box asking if the user desires to save the current text upon clicking "Open" or "New" in the future.
